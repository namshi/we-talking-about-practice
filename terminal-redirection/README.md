# Terminal redirection

The terminal has an incredible amount of features: one of them, redirection,
gives you incredible superpowers :)

In this exercise you should:

* save the contents of `ls -la` into a file called `~/ls-output.txt`
* copy the contents of `/etc/hosts` into `~/new-hosts` without using `cp`
* remove all contents inside `~/new-hosts`

All of the above tasks should be done using output redirection -- so try
to be clever when googling! :)
