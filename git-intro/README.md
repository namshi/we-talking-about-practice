# Git intro

Let's play a little bit with git:

* create a new git repo under `/tmp/git-intro`
* create a new repo on github with the same name (`git-intro`) and use it as a remote for your local repo
* add an empty `a.txt` file into it
* commit
* add `b.txt` which contains the string "1 2 3"
* remove `a.txt`
* commit
* create a new branch called `my-branch`
* add a new empty file `c.txt`
* commit
* push
* delete the branch `my-branch` locally
* tag version `1.0`
* push your tag
* delete tag `1.0` locally
* delete tag `1.0` on the remote
